# Parallel Processing

Here are some examples of **parallel processing**.

<Callout type="warning">
  **Parallel Processing is Not True Parallel**
  <br />
  See [cautions](/learn/caution/parallel) for more information.
</Callout>

## General usage

Here are the most common ways to spawn processor threads.

### On-Demand Threads

These threads are created on runtime and are not started automatically.
Calling `thread.ParallelProcessing.start()` will start the thread immediately.
1

```py
import time
import thread

def my_processor(x):
  time.wait(5)
  print('My processing task is complete.')
  return x

worker = thread.ParallelProcessing(function=my_processor, dataset=(1,))
worker.start()

print('Started processing task.')

worker.join() # Halt the main thread until the threads finish.
worker.get_return_values() # [1]

# Terminal output:
# > Started processing task.
# > My processing task is complete.
```

### Decoratored Functions

Decoratored functions automatically spawn new threads and run in the background everytime they are called,
simply use `thread.processor` to decorate the function.

```py
import time
import thread

@thread.processor
def my_processor(x):
  time.wait(5)
  print('My processing task is complete.')
  return x

worker = my_background_task([1, 2, 3])
print('Started processing task.')

worker.join()
worker.get_return_values() # [1, 2, 3]

# Terminal output:
# > Started processing task.
# > My processing task is complete.
```

## Type Safety

Thread supports type annotations for Python **3.9+**.
This will help your LSP to detect type errors and reduce the risk of runtime errors.

### A Simple Example

All that is needed is to annotate the function like you would in Python.

```py
import thread

def processor_function(x: int) -> int:
  return x + 1

worker = thread.ParallelProcessing(function=processor_function, dataset=(1,))
worker.start()
returned = worker.get_return_value() # list[int]
```
