# Threading Examples

Here are some examples of using **thread** to run code in sub threads.

## General usage

Here are the most common ways to spawn threads.

### On-Demand Threads
These threads are created on runtime and are not started automatically.
Calling `thread.Thread.start()` will start the thread immediately.

```py
import time
import thread

def my_background_task():
  time.wait(5)
  print('My background task is complete.')

worker = thread.Thread(target=my_background_task)
worker.start()

print('Started background task.')

worker.join() # Halt the main thread until the background thread finishes.

# Terminal output:
# > Started background task.
# > My background task is complete.
```

### Decoratored Functions
Decoratored functions automatically spawn new threads and run in the background everytime they are called,
simply use `thread.threaded` to decorate the function.

```py
import time
import thread

@thread.threaded
def my_background_task():
  time.wait(5)
  print('My background task is complete.')

worker = my_background_task()
print('Started background task.')

worker.join()

# Terminal output:
# > Started background task.
# > My background task is complete.
```

## Type Safety

Thread supports type annotations for Python **3.9+**.
This will help your LSP to detect type errors and reduce the risk of runtime errors.

### A Simple Example
All that is needed is to annotate the function like you would in Python.

```py
import thread

def background_function(x: int) -> int:
  return x + 1

worker = Thread(target=background_function, args=(5,))
worker.start()
returned = worker.get_return_value() # int
```
