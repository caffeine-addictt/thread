# Parallelism

<Callout type='warning'>
  This is a Python intended default behaviour.
</Callout>

### The Scope

At present, this affects everything in **thread**.

### Why Is This So?

This is due to Python's **GIL** (Global Interpreter Lock).
At present, we only extend the featureset for the built-in `threading` library which means we are limited and bound by the **GIL**.

Check out this video by [Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/@TechWithTim) for a more in-depth explanation:

### What Does This Mean?

This means that threaded processes will only be able to fully utilise the one main Interpreter.
Threaded processes still are able to run simultaneously with other processes, just limited to one Interpreter.

### What If I Want True Parallel?

As outlined in the video above, you can achieve this with Python's built-in `multiprocessing` library.

### Are There Plans to Provide True Parallelism in the Future?

Yes, and we are planning to add support for this in the future.
